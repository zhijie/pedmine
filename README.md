Pedmine
=======

Pedmine is a PHP variant of the popular Ruby on Rails web-based project management tool Redmine (http://redmine.org).

This project is born to help people who have problems with deploying Redmine. Ruby is not as easy as PHP to deploy. And PHP is more widely supported by current web hosting services.

If you find this project interesting, feel free to contribute and contact :)
